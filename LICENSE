DISCLAIMER & SECURITY NOTICE

This software is provided as-is for hackathon and development purposes. It is
NOT AUDITED and should NOT be used in production without professional security
review. The developers make NO WARRANTY as to the security, functionality, or
fitness for any particular purpose.

Key Risks:
- Unaudited smart contracts may contain critical vulnerabilities
- UUPS upgradeable pattern requires careful storage layout management
- Role-based access control depends on proper initialization
- EIP-712 signature validation is only as strong as the signer's key management

Before deploying to mainnet:
1. Conduct a full security audit by professional auditors
2. Perform extensive testing on testnet
3. Implement proper key management and access controls
4. Review and understand all dependencies (OpenZeppelin, Hardhat, etc.)
5. Have an upgrade and emergency response plan
